## 1. Code Hosting:

The code for the "Eldoria's Ring Adventure" game can be hosted on a version control platform like GitHub, GitLab, or any python running program/sandbox. 

## 2. External Services:

No external services are currently integrated into the game. All functionalities are self-contained within the codebase.

## 3. Languages and Technologies:

The game is developed using Python programming language.

No specific external libraries or frameworks are utilized beyond Python's standard libraries.

## 4. System Requirements and Supported Applications:

System Requirements: The game can run on any system with Python installed.

Supported Applications: The game is designed to be run in a terminal or command prompt environment.

## 5. Coding/Naming Conventions:

The code follows guidelines for Python code style and conventions.

Meaningful variable and function names are used to enhance code readability and maintainability.
Consistent indentation and formatting are applied throughout the codebase.

## 6. How to Run/Build/Deploy the Program:

Run: To run the game, execute the main Python script containing the game's logic. For example, in a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Python script and run python Chapter_1(). The rest of the chapters should run automatically.

Build/Deploy: No explicit build or deployment process is required as the game is a standalone Python script. 

## 7. Overview of Architecture:

The game is structured using object-oriented programming principles.
It consists of multiple chapters, each containing a set of actions, interactions, and decisions for the player.
Each chapter is encapsulated within a class, providing modularity and ease of expansion for additional chapters or features.
The flow of the game is linear, progressing from one chapter to the next based on player decisions and actions.

## 8. How to Start the Program (Start the Game):

To start the game, run the main script file containing the entry point of the game. In this case, execute the Chapter_1() method of the GameChapter class. This initiates the first chapter of the game, prompting the player to interact with the storyline and make decisions.
Once the first chapter is completed, subsequent chapters are sequentially started by calling the respective chapter functions (chapter_2(), chapter_3(), etc.) until the final chapter is reached.
